# IC3IT 2024 Conference Submission

This repository contains the code snippets used in our submission to the [First International Conference on Innovative and Intelligent Information Technologies (IC3IT 2024)](https://conference.univ-batna2.dz/ic3it24), held from December 3-5, 2024, in Batna, Algeria. The paper provides a performance evaluation of several quantum transpilers, including the qiskit-braket-provider, qBraid-SDK, and pytket extensions, focusing on metrics such as correctness, failure rate, and transpilation time.

The code in this repository illustrates the methodology used for benchmarking quantum transpilers. It is designed to complement the findings presented in the paper by providing practical examples and insights into the benchmarking process. Please note that the code in this repository relies on two dependencies: `randomqc` and `benchmarq`. These packages are currently closed-source and not publicly available. As a result, the code provided here is intended for demonstration purposes only and may not run without access to these specific dependencies. If you have any questions or need further information, please refer to the paper ([preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06836)) or contact the authors directly.
